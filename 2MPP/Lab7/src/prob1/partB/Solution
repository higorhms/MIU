The equals() method was overriden incorrectly, using an instance of Employee as parameter:

Old: 	
  public boolean equals(Employee e) {
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}

I Fixed overriding the equals method correctly:
  @Override
	public boolean equals(Object incoming) {
		Employee e = (Employee) incoming;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
